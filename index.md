title: Gorilla REPL
---

Gorilla is a rich REPL for Clojure in the notebook style. What on earth does that mean, you say? Well, maybe it's best
to take a look at a [short video](https://vimeo.com/87118206) showing you what it can do:

You can think of it like a pretty REPL that can plot graphs, or you can think of it as an editor for rich documents that
can contain interactive Clojure code, graphs, table, notes, LaTeX formulae. Whatever works for you! One of the main
aims is to make it lightweight enough that you can use it day-to-day instead of the command-line REPL, but also offer
the power to perform and document complex data analysis and modelling tasks. Above all else, Gorilla tries not to
dictate your workflow, but rather to fit in to the way you like to work, hopefully putting a bit more power to your
elbow.

## Learning more

The first thing you should do is read the [getting started](/start.html) page which runs through the installation of
Gorilla and its basic operation. Gorilla has a very flexible renderer, and if you start using Gorilla frequently you
will probably want to learn how it works. You can find all the information you need on the [renderer](/renderer.html)
page.
