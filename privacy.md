On the whole, we don't collect much in the way of information about our users, but for the sake of completeness we list
here what we do do:

- The `gorilla-repl.org` website, and the online viewer `viewer.gorilla-repl.org`, use http://gaug.es to keep access
statistics. This means that a few cookies are sent to the gaug.es servers each time you visit a page, as well as your IP
address and some information about your browser environment. gaug.es presents a summary of this information to us, with
no personally identifying information. We use this, mainly, to see how people are finding out about Gorilla REPL, and
which parts of the website they find most interesting.

- As of version 0.3.x, Gorilla REPL makes a request to the server `updates.gorilla-repl.org` when it starts up,
to see if there's a more recent version available. In this request, it sends the current version of Gorilla REPL that
you're using. We keep statistics on how many requests we get from each version. We do not store any personal
information, like your IP, or any anonymous identifier, like a cookie. Your IP address will be transiently recorded in
Heroku's logs, but these are purged on a short timescale, and we tend not to look at them anyway - unless something is
broken.

- The source code is hosted on Github. This is a third-party website that uses cookies. Details of their privacy policy
can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-policy) .
