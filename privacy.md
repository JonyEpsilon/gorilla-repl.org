On the whole, we don't collect much in the way of information about our users, but for the sake of completeness we list
here what we do do:

- The `gorilla-repl.org` website, and the online viewer `viewer.gorilla-repl.org`, use analytics software to keep access
statistics. This means that a few cookies are sent to the analytics servers each time you visit a page, as well as your IP
address and some information about your browser environment. The analytics software presents a summary of this information
to us, with no personally identifying information. We use this, mainly, to see how people are finding out about Gorilla
REPL, and which parts of the website they find most interesting.

- As of version 0.3.x, Gorilla REPL makes a request to the server `updates.gorilla-repl.org` when it starts up,
to see if there's a more recent version available. Blocking this request will cause no problems at all. In this request,
Gorilla REPL includes the current version that you're using. We keep statistics on how many requests we get from each
version. We do not send, receive, or store any personal information.

- The source code is hosted on Github. This is a third-party website that uses cookies. Details of their privacy policy
can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-policy) .
